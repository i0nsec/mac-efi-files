# Mac-EFI Files
I work for a computer repair shop and I sometimes remove EFI passwords from: MacBook Pro/Air, iMac, iMac Pro, and more. And I started saving the dumped files just in case I have to reuse them for other projects. Currently, I only have a few that I kept during my previous repairs.

### Here are some of the ones I have included in this repo

|Device|Year|Serial Number|
|---------|-----:|-----------------|
|MacBook Air|2017|C02TLC7FJ1WK|
|MacBook Air|2014|C02MQB1KG083|
|MacBook Pro|2012|C02KN1JKDR53|
|MacBook Pro|2013|C02MM7M2FD56|
|MacBook Pro|2015|C02VD3CJG8WN|

I will be keeping this repo updated as much as I get devices hopefully.
