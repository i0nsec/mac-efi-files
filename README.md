# Mac-EFI Files
I remove EFI passwords from Apple: MacBook Pro/Air, iMac, iMac Pro, and more. And I started saving the dumped files just in case I have to reuse them for other projects. Currently, I only have a few that I kept during my previous repairs.

### Here are some of the ones I have included in this repo
